  <p>The original American Bubble Waffle was based on the street food craze known as "egg waffles" in Hong Kong. With a special
  waffle iron and multiple waffle batter flavors, "egg waffles" quickly became a popular snack/breakfast item.
  After millions on pintrest, instagram and webblog posts, Bubble Waffes made its way to America, making it 
    a delicious international treat. <br> While "egg wafles" were normaly served plain or with a variety of fruit,
   Bubble Waffles serves these tasty treats as an icecream cone with homemade creamy icecream and toppings. A classic dish 
  trasformed into a new food craze that anyone can enjoy.</p>
