<h1>Black Goose Bistro Gallery</h1>
<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>
<p><a href="bread.html"><img src="thumbnails/bread-200.jpg" alt="close-up of sliced rustic bread" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>
<p><a href="burgers.html"><img src="thumbnails/burgers-200.jpg" alt="close-up of grilled burgers" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>
<p><a href="fish.html"><img src="thumbnails/fish-200.jpg" alt="close-up of the catch of the day" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>

<h2>Our Fried Chicken</h2>
<p><a href="chicken.html"><img src="thumbnails/chicken-200.jpg" alt="close-up of fried chicken" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
Our world-famous boneless marinated fried chicken is always hand-breaded and fried to perfection.</p>

<h2>Our Seasoned Fries</h2>
<p><a href="fries.html"><img src="thumbnails/fries-200.jpg" alt="close-up of our french fries" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
What's a good burger if you don't have a basket full of fries to go with it? Our fresh fries are fried until they're golden yellow and with just a sprinkle of salt.
Come try them with our house-made ketchep or honey mustard for a sweet and salty bite.</p>

<h2>Fresh Tabouleh</h2>
<p><a href="tabouleh.html"><img src="thumbnails/tabouleh-200.jpg" alt="close-up of fresh tabouleh" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
Mixed with finely chopped parsley, tomatoes, mint, bulgur, and a dash of lemon juice and seasonings creates the perfect Levantine vegetarian salad. This dish screams summer and is a fresh breeze of freshness.
